# 🧠 Deep Learning for Time Series Prediction of Exercise-Induced Neuroplasticity in Neurodegenerative Diseases

## 🌐 Project Overview

**Exercise-induced neuroplasticity** plays a crucial role in brain adaptability and resilience, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases. However, traditional predictive models often struggle with the temporal and spatial complexities of neuroplasticity due to:

- 🧩 **Limited Multimodal Data Integration**  
- ⏳ **Inability to Model Temporal Dynamics Effectively**  
- 🧠 **Lack of Biologically Grounded Constraints**  

To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel solution:

### 🚀 **Adaptive Neuroplasticity Prediction Framework (ANPF)**  
- **Incorporates biologically inspired mechanisms** for synaptic and structural plasticity.  
- **Uses advanced deep learning models** to predict neural dynamics over time.  

### ⚙️ **Neuroplasticity-Informed Optimization Strategy (NIOS)**  
- Embeds **neuroscientific principles** into the model optimization process.  
- Leverages **multimodal data**, **dynamic regularization**, and **biologically plausible constraints**.  

**Our framework predicts dynamic neural adaptations with enhanced precision, scalability, and interpretability**, providing new insights into **neurorehabilitation** and **exercise-induced neuroplasticity**.

## 🧬 Framework Architecture

Our framework is composed of three core components:

### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing Module**  
- Converts raw multimodal datasets (e.g., fMRI, EEG) into structured time-series representations.  
- Performs normalization, noise reduction, and feature engineering based on neurobiological markers.  

### 2️⃣ **Predictive Modeling Core (ANPF)**  
- Employs **LSTM**, **GRU**, and **Transformer** models to capture temporal neural dynamics.  
- Uses **multi-scale convolutional layers** to integrate structural and functional neuroplasticity signals.  

### 3️⃣ **Optimization Engine (NIOS)**  
- Integrates **biologically grounded constraints** into the training loop.  
- Utilizes **dynamic regularization** to prevent model overfitting while ensuring biological plausibility.  

**Visualization Example:**  
🧠 Neural time-series data → Feature extraction → Model prediction → Explainable insights
